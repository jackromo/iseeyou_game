Horror Game

Requirements:
-Python 2.7
-Pygame
-Linux distro OS

This is a top-down 2D survival horror game.
The player starts in a random tunnel network, having only a flashlight with limited FOV.
An invisible enemy starts some distance from the player, who the player must evade throughout the game.
The opponent slowly follows the player based on the noises they make, and cannot be looked at; if the player does, the enemy will move many times faster.
The enemy is also invisible unless the player shines their flashlight directly at them - if they do, they will see a series of footsteps running towards them.
The player must listen for the enemy's sound (static noise) while running (loud), walking (some noise) and sneaking (no noise) to keep away.
The goal is to find exits to each dungeon floor and advance as many floors down the labyrinth as possible before dying at the hands of the enemy.

Current features:
-Working World generation algorithm
-Ability to draw world to screen
-Can detect if currently in hallways of world or not
-Working eventGet -> update -> render loop in GameSession
-Player and Enemy classes
-Player movement controls
-Collision detection w/ walls for player
-Flashlight class for directed light rendering algorithm
-Enemy display and AI
  - Only visible if flashlight shining directly at it
  - Exists in 4 possible states of behaviour
    - wandering: moving from hallway intersection to intersection in random sequences, has not detected player
    - following: has detected sound of player from a distance, going from intersection to intersection, can be heard quietly
    - close:     is following player and is on screen somewhere, moving directly towards player, can be heard loudly
    - chasing:   has been hit w/ flashlight and is on screen, like 'close' but very fast
    - returning: player has escaped enemy, is now returning to closest intersection + return to 'wandering' state
-Sound effects for player and enemy
  - Footsteps for player
  - Static sound effect for enemy that gets louder when closer to player
-Paused status (press ESC)
-Ability to die by being hit by enemy
-Multiple 'levels', ie. floors to dungeon
  -Next one can be accessed by getting to exit on current dungeon floor
  -Each level = new randomly generated world
-Running, walking and sneaking controls for player
  -Running = loud (enemy will hear player from anywhere), walking = moderate volume, sneaking = quiet, standing = silent
  -Stamina for running = limited, need to recharge afterwards
-Add main menu
  -Play, controls and quit options
  -Background = fake game session, flashlight moves w/ mouse
-Fade transition between dungeon levels and from menu to game
-Messages displayed by enemy when things happen
  -At random, about every 1.5 mins, a lowercase no-spaces line is shown in dark red at bottom right corner of screen
-Better image for exit region created, a series of darker + darker layers going down as a hole


Planned features:
-Textures for floor, exit, player, and enemy
-More sounds for enemy, eg. heavy breathing or more static overlayed when closer
